## Features
- Django as backend Framework.
- Standard user management, authentication, users across tournaments.
- Remote authentication using 42's OAuth2.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT.
- Remote (Online) players.
- AI opponents.
- Blockchain - The score of each game is recorded in a blockchain.
- PostgreSQL as database.
- Bootstrap as a front-end tooltik.
- Browser Compatibility: Chrome, Firefox.
  
## Our implementation

#### Frontend:

- A Single Page Application (SPA) utilizing a class-based system for managing navigation and rendering of pages and components.
- It communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs and WebSockets, allowing for real-time updates.
- App, pages and components have their own state management. State is updated on WebSocket events, API calls, and user interactions.
- Using the Observer pattern, pages and components can subscribe to state changes and re-render when necessary.

#### Backend:

- Django REST Framework was used to build a backend API, providing endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
- Django Channels was used for WebSocket communication, allowing for real-time updates.
- Simple JWT was used for authentication, and a custom OAuth2 backend was implemented to handle 42's OAuth2.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure ports 8080 and 8000 are free on your machine.
- Docker and Docker Compose should be installed.
  
Copy the example environment from `.env.example` to `.env`. If needed, update credentials such as email client and 42's OAuth2.


## Running the Application

The following commands are available in the Makefile:
